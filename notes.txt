// I have managed to get the actual position of the mouse, I just have
to pass into the getPosition() my window object.

When I change the map I need to delete the button.
I will have to create them dynamically

I might also want to stop checking the position of the player, or change
it based on the current room he is in.


I could pass a variable to the changeMap() function, make a bunch of
if statements over that that check which map is supposed to load

create a changeMapHouse()
withing it:
	- change the map image,
	- delete the button,
	- change the coordinates of the exit/entrace

The issue with not changing the map properly and position exists
becuase I'm not able to receive just ONE mouse click.
It registeres multiple of them and that messes everything up.
If i get that wot work, my only real problem is changing the
position of the button inside the house.
 I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG!


 The best way to pass in a mouse event:
 event.type == event.MouseButtonPressed && event.mouseButton.button == lmb
 and then set event type to MouseButtonReleased.
